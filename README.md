### What is Edesia? 

Edesia is a food commerce website where users can log in, find meals that are being prepared near their location for the next meal time and place an order. The meals are prepared by local caterers, making Edesia a lower cost, homemade alternative to popular meal ordering platforms. 

### Building Edesia

Edesia is my independently built project. I utilized the MERN stack, except relying heavily on MySQL instead of MongoDB. MySQL is used to store and manage users' profiles, caterers, meals, and orders. MongoDB will be used to store user reviews for meals. 

The front end is made using React.js and is being built to be completely mobile responsive. Stripe is utilized for purchases. More to come soon!

Please do leave suggestions and comments!
